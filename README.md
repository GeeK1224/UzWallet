> This is an Educational Project, which was created only for the sake of education. NON-COMMERCIAL PRODUCT.

In Tashkent, we have wide variety of shops and markets which offer loyalty programs. This includes having physical discount cards or in-app QR codes. Which means you need to have cards and apps for each of the shops, which you frequently visit, in your hand. But indeed, it is inconvenient, and we often forget to take these cards when going shopping and, perhaps you are unaware, certain shops offer loyalty programs. Moreover, not everyone has phones with proper memory storage to install all shop applications. By matter of fact, we suffer and witness such obstacles personally.

Therefore, we would like to create an application that keeps all discount and loyalty cards of all local shops and markets in one place. With UzWallet you are able to add and keep all your reward cards inside one application. Our software allows users to use these cards at any time and anywhere. Additionally, with cooperation with shops, Uzwallet will let you register and open a loyalty card directly inside the application, without submitting your details at the shop personally. Moreover, we are going to make inside app advertisements of loyalty programs with luring offers from shops. Thereby, we will invoke users to obtain loyalty cards and try to use them in the shop. This approach will assist shops to increase the base of regular customers.

As a whole, we would like to create a comfortable environment for people in order to help them to use discount offers as efficiently as possible, saving them money and time.
